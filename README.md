- Second step will be flashing Tasmota on Sonoff TH16.
- 1- Goto https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-TH/ and read.
- 2- Get a FTDI Module and make wire connections like this

- 3.3v <-------> 3.3v
- GND <--------> GND
- TX <---------> RX
- RX <---------> TX
 
- 3- Goto https://github.com/tasmota/tasmotizer and download Tasmotizer and happy hack.

- In case you have doubts don't forget make a Googling, this is a very documented subject on the internet and that's why I won't go into detail.
After Tasmota is connected to your wifi and configured as "Sonoff TH" let's move on or next step.

#
- Third step we go to the tasmota console and create the following RULES.
